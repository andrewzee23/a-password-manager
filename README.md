**NO SECUIRTY**

1. First, run tables.py to create database and table for passwords.
2. Run app.py and enjoy.


|key        |description|
|-----------|-----------|
| a         | populates all records in database|
| d         | deletes record using the 'id'|
| e         | creates a new record in the database|
| q         | quits the program|
| s         | searches database on different parameters|
| u         | allows user to update record in database|


Inspiration for this was simple. I wanted to create something like this and after searching for a tutorial to no success. I decided to take a stab and at and well, here it is.
